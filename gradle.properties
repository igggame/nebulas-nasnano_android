#ViewBinding classes are generated by the Android Gradle Plugin before the java compiler. This avoids getting too many false positive errors if java compilation fails for an unrelated reason.
#In V1, the binding classes for libraries would be regenerated when the app is compiled (to share generated code and access to the final `BR` and `R` files). In V2, libraries keep their generated binding classes as well as the mapper information which improves data binding performance significantly for multi-module projects.
